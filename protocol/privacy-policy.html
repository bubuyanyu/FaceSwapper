        <li>The right to request proper rectification or removal of your personal information or restriction of the
            processing of your personal information;</li>
        <li>Where processing of your personal information is either based on your consent or necessary for the
            performance
            of a contract with you and processing is carried out by automated means, the right to receive the personal
            information concerning you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to have your
            personal
            information transmitted directly to another company, where technically feasible (data portability);</li>
        <li>Where the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, the right to withdraw your
            consent

            such processing, we ask you to state the grounds of your objection in order for us to examine the processing
            of

            processing;</li>
        <li>The right to object to processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes; and</li>
        <li>The right to lodge complaints before the competent data protection regulator.</li>
